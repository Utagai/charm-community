# The power of the community

Welcome to charm community!

A community-led project that is officially backed by the [charmbracelet][charm] organization.

## Our projects

- [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles], a collection of bubbles for the [bubbletea][bubbletea] library.
- [awesome-charm][awesome-charm], the best of what the CLI has to offer.

## How can I get involved?

We are always looking for more libraries, bubbles, and other awesome projects to include in our collection.

### How can I get my library added?

The first question you should ask is "is this better as a bubble?" If the answer is yes, consider adding it to the [additional-bubbles][additional-bubbles].
If you think your project is better suited as a standalone library, then you can make a [new discussion][new-discussion].
From there, the community will leave feedback and help get your project added to the charm-community organization.

### How can I get my plugin/exertion added?

If you have an awesome neovim plugin or a cool VSCode exertion, then you can make a [new discussion][new-discussion].
From there, the community will leave feedback and help get your project added to the charm-community organization.

### But what if I don't want to transfer ownership?

That's totally fine!
You can add your project to the [awesome-charm][awesome-charm] list.
